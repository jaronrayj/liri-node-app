# liri-node-app

## Overview

Run searches for concerts, songs or movies through Bands in Town API, OMDB API, and Spotify API.

## Setup

* Download files to your computer
* Run ```npm i``` to install the package.json npm's
* On the .env file you'll need to set up keys for Spotify, Bands in Town, and OMDB. You can follow this format:
```# Spotify API keys

SPOTIFY_ID=*id*
SPOTIFY_SECRET=*secret*

# Bands in town keys

BANDS_KEY=*key*

# OMDB

OMDB_KEY=*key*
```

* Run ```node liri.js``` to initiate search

## Demonstration

Once up and running, choose what type of search you would like to run, and then input the type of concert, song, or movie that you want to search for. On "do-what-it-says" it will run the 'random.txt' file with whatever commands exists there.

Here is a video that shows how it works:
